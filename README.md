# trig encryption
A trig based encryption algorithim that utilizes the equation x+cos(y)=z and performs 200 rounds (which can be changed). It accepts all characters on an US keyboard layout.

The idea comes from the fact that you cannot solve for x in x+cos(y)=z when performing multiple rounds. x+cos(x+cos(...(cos(x+y)=z cannot have x isolated.
